    The game that I created with my partner Cathy Pham is called Bear Chomper which allows the hungry bear to catch falling decent food such as tacos, cheetos puffs and muffins to eat.
  But decent food was not the only thing falling from the sky, inedible thing such as insects and mouse were falling as well. 
  The bear however has five chances to avoid the disease or he will die.
  With given tips offered in the scratch website, our game started off as simple until we started to enhance it by adding effects, obstacles and lives.
  I believe the hardest obstacles that my partner and I encountered was how to make levels such as easy and hard and how to literally end the game after the lives has hit 0.
  Opportunities we have taken advantage was that we added was more food for the player to gain points and bad things that will end the game.
  I like how we had lives in our game so we can feel intense and in competition.
  In the process of making the game, we were able to fiddle around the settings to see how it will help influence our game such as creating pictures in the costumes section and creating varibles. 
  We also learned how to make the food forever dropping from the sky at random spot which results points in the scoreboard and control the speed of how fast the objects was falling.
